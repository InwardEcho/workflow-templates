# Comprehensive CI/CD Strategy & Implementation Plan for C# Applications

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) strategy and implementation plan for C# applications. The goal is to establish a robust, secure, efficient, and maintainable CI/CD ecosystem using GitHub Organizational Workflow Templates. This plan is designed from the ground up, leveraging the detailed requirements and analysis presented in `req.md` and subsequent discussions.

## 2. Core CI/CD Principles

The strategy and templates will adhere to the following fundamental principles:

1.  **Automation:** Automate all processes from build to deployment to minimize manual intervention and errors.
2.  **Early & Frequent Integration:** Encourage developers to integrate code into a shared repository frequently.
3.  **Continuous Testing & Quality Gates:** Implement automated tests at various stages (unit, integration, etc.) to ensure code quality and catch issues early.
4.  **Security by Design (DevSecOps):** Integrate security scanning and best practices throughout the software development lifecycle, leveraging GitHub's native security features.
5.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Integration:** Design for seamless integration with Terraform for environment provisioning and management.
6.  **Observability:** Ensure pipelines and deployed applications provide sufficient logs, metrics, and traces for effective monitoring and troubleshooting.
7.  **Progressive Delivery:** Employ strategies like canary releases for safer production rollouts and risk mitigation.
8.  **Reusability & Standardization:** Utilize GitHub Organizational Workflow Templates to ensure consistency, reduce boilerplate code across projects, and promote best practices.
9.  **Clear Governance & Approvals:** Implement appropriate approval workflows for sensitive operations, particularly for promotions to staging and production environments.
10. **Comprehensive Artifact Management:** Define clear strategies for versioning, storing, and retaining build artifacts (NuGet packages, deployment packages, reports).

## 3. Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundational Design & Strategy (Architect Mode)

*   **Objective:** Define the complete CI/CD strategy, specify all organizational workflow templates, and outline key governance and process documents.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Finalize this strategy document.
    *   Create detailed specifications for each organizational workflow template (see Section 4).
    *   Develop high-level designs for:
        *   Overall CI/CD Flow Diagram (illustrating template usage).
        *   Branching Strategy (e.g., GitHub Flow with protected `main` branch).
        *   Environment Promotion Strategy (including approval matrix).
        *   Release Management Process (versioning, release notes, artifact handling).
        *   Security Integration Policy (leveraging GitHub native features).
        *   Error Handling & Rollback Philosophy (must define triggers and mechanisms for automated rollbacks for standard deployments based on post-deployment health check failures).
        *   Define Audit Trail Strategy: Outline requirements for audit trail generation, covering key CI/CD events, deployment activities, and security-sensitive operations. Evaluate leveraging GitHub's native audit logs and/or integration with external SIEM/logging systems. Identify if specific logging needs to be built into workflow templates.
        *   Develop Compliance Reporting Framework: Specify what compliance reports are necessary (e.g., from security scans, test coverage, audit logs). Define how these reports will be generated, consolidated, and made accessible. This may involve configuring templates like `org-security-github.yml` or the planned `org-static-code-analysis.yml` to output specific report formats.
        *   Documentation Standards for templates and pipelines.
*   **Deliverables:** This document, detailed template specifications, and high-level designs for strategic guidelines.

### Phase 2: Template Implementation (Code Mode)

*   **Objective:** Develop and document all organizational workflow templates and supporting assets.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Set up the organization-level `.github` repository (e.g., `org-workflows`) to host `workflow-templates`.
    *   Develop each `.yml` workflow template based on Phase 1 specifications.
    *   Create corresponding `.properties.json` metadata files for UI discoverability.
    *   Develop any necessary helper scripts (e.g., PowerShell, Bash), versioned within the organizational repository.
    *   Write comprehensive `README.md` documentation for the `workflow-templates` directory, covering strategy, usage, and examples.
    *   Provide example "caller" workflow files demonstrating how application repositories will consume these organizational templates.
*   **Deliverables:** Fully implemented and documented organizational workflow templates, helper scripts, and example usage workflows.

### Phase 3: Pilot, Refinement & Rollout

*   **Objective:** Validate the templates, gather feedback, and plan for organizational adoption.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Select a pilot C# project for integration.
    *   Execute and thoroughly test the CI/CD pipeline for the pilot project.
    *   Gather feedback from the pilot team and iterate on templates/documentation.
    *   Define and implement an initial application and infrastructure alerting strategy. This includes identifying key metrics for monitoring deployed applications and setting up basic alerts for critical failures or performance degradation, potentially integrating with the `org-observability-hooks.yml` for triggering notifications or by configuring external monitoring tools.
    *   Establish initial log aggregation capabilities. This involves defining how application logs will be collected, stored, and accessed (e.g., configuring applications to output structured logs and forwarding them to a central store). The `org-observability-hooks.yml` might be updated to include steps for configuring log shipping or referencing centralized logging endpoints.
    *   Develop a plan for a phased rollout to other C# projects.
    *   Provide training/workshops for development teams.
*   **Deliverables:** Tested and refined templates, rollout plan, training materials.

## 4. Organizational Workflow Templates

The following GitHub Organizational Workflow Templates will be created:

1.  **`org-build-test-dotnet.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Compile, test (.NET unit, integration), and package C# applications.
    *   *Features*: Handles multiple .NET versions, solution/project paths, build configurations, multi-targeted frameworks, NuGet package caching, test result reporting, basic artifact generation (e.g., deployment packages, test reports).
2.  **`org-versioning.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Calculate or derive application versions using GitHub-native mechanisms (e.g., `github.run_number`, `github.sha`, tag-based strategies) or simple, well-integrated GitHub Actions.
    *   *Features*: Outputs calculated version string, supports pre-release concepts if needed (e.g., via git tags like `v1.2.3-beta.1`).
3.  **`org-publish-nuget.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Publish NuGet packages to a specified feed (e.g., GitHub Packages, Azure Artifacts, Nexus).
    *   *Features*: Handles package versioning (takes version as input), feed authentication via secrets.
4.  **`org-security-github.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Orchestrate GitHub's native security features for DevSecOps.
    *   *Features*: Integrates CodeQL (SAST), secret scanning, and dependency review/vulnerability alerts. Configuration options for these tools.
5.  **`org-iac-terraform.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Provide standardized steps for integrating with Terraform for infrastructure management.
    *   *Features*: Supports `terraform init`, `terraform validate` (for syntax and static analysis), `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`. Manages Terraform workspaces, backend configuration (passed as inputs/secrets), and plan output.
6.  **`org-deploy-environment.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Generic deployment workflow for applications to different environments (dev, test, staging, prod).
    *   *Features*: Handles environment-specific configurations/secrets, calls deployment scripts or tools (e.g., Azure App Service deployment, Kubernetes deployment), basic post-deployment health checks with configurable automated rollback triggers if critical checks fail.
7.  **`org-promote-environment.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Manage controlled promotion of builds/artifacts between environments with approval gates.
    *   *Features*: `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual initiation, choice of source/target environments, version/artifact identifier input, validation of promotion paths (e.g., dev -> test -> staging -> prod), integration with GitHub environments for approvals.
8.  **`org-canary-deployment.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Implement a canary release strategy for .NET applications to minimize deployment risk.
    *   *Features*: Deploys new version to a small subset of infrastructure/users, monitors health and key metrics for a defined period, automated rollback on failure detection, and full promotion on success.
9.  **`org-database-migration-efcore.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Manage Entity Framework Core database schema migrations in an automated and safe manner.
    *   *Features*: Optional database backup step before migration, applying EF Core migrations (`dotnet ef database update`), environment-specific database connection string handling via secrets, and an optional step to generate a schema diff report (e.g., using `ef bundle --dry-run` or a similar mechanism) before applying migrations to help identify potential unintended changes or drift.
10. **`org-observability-hooks.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Standardize integration points for pipeline and application observability.
    *   *Features*: Send notifications on pipeline status (success/failure) to channels like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email. Future: push custom metrics to monitoring systems, configure log aggregation points.
11. **`org-static-code-analysis.yml`**:
    *   *Purpose*: Perform comprehensive static code analysis, including security checks (beyond basic CodeQL if specialized tools are needed for C#), code quality metrics, and code duplication detection.
    *   *Features*: Integrates with tools like SonarQube (if available/planned), or specific linters/analyzers for C#, and a code duplication detection tool (e.g., a .NET equivalent of jscpd or built-in features of larger analysis suites). Configurable thresholds and reporting.

## 5. Key Tooling Decisions (Based on User Feedback)

*   **Versioning:** Utilize GitHub-native mechanisms or simple, well-integrated GitHub Actions.
*   **Security Scanning:** Leverage GitHub's native security features (CodeQL, secret scanning, dependency review).
*   **Database Migration:** Focus on Entity Framework Core migrations (`dotnet ef database update`).
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Support Terraform.
*   **Windows-Specific Needs:** Currently no specific requirements; therefore, no dedicated Windows-specific template will be created initially.
*   **Artifact Storage & Retention:**
    *   **Short-term (build/test artifacts):** GitHub Actions artifacts. Retention managed via script (based on `req.md` example).
    *   **NuGet Packages:** Published to a designated NuGet feed.
    *   **Long-term (release packages):** To be determined if needed beyond NuGet. If so, Azure Blob Storage or similar could be considered.
*   **Container Scanning:** If the organization adopts containerized deployments for C# applications in the future, a dedicated workflow template or an extension to `org-security-github.yml` will be developed to integrate container image scanning (e.g., Trivy, Clair, or GitHub's native capabilities if enhanced).
